## Web Scrapping Kata

## Description

Web scraping is a technique used to extract large amounts of data from websites whereby the data is
extracted and saved to a local file in your computer or to a database in a tabular form.
Here is how a typical web scraping process works:

1. A web scraper sends a GET request to the URL that you have instructed it to scrape.
2. The server responds to the request by returning the HTML content of the webpage.
3. The web scraper then parses the HTML content of the page, filters out the data it needs,
   and saves this data into a format you want.

This project illustrates Web Scrapping challenges and concepts, showing how to:

- Set up a Selenium web scrapping java.
- Set up web scrapping service docker image using _Firefox_, _GeckoDriver_, and [Spring Boot layered Jar](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-docker-images#layered-jars).
- Automate WebDriver management using [WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager).
- Manage WebDriver instances in a multi-threaded environment.
- Implement WebDriver pooling manager using Apache Common pool.
- Implement Page Object Pattern.
